        Using the ID is the most reliable way to look up an item, as it is always unique. You can find the Item ID by opening the item in the Bitwarden Web Vault and copying it from the browser's address bar.

        The ID is the long string of characters that comes immediately after <code>itemId=</code> in the URL.
